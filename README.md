# Simple Level Editor (ALPHA)

Simple cross-platform 3D level editor written in C# and F# using .NET 8, OpenGL and ImGui.

## Features

Build levels using .obj meshes and .tga textures. More formats will be supported later.

Levels are saved as JSON for readability and ease of use. Levels can be deserialized using the `NoahStolk.SimpleLevelEditor.Formats` NuGet package.

Currently, there is only a Windows build, but it should be easy to create builds for Mac and Linux.
