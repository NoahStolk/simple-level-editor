MEDIUM PRIORITY

BACKLOG
- Multiple selection

- Terrain editor?

REFACTORING
- Refactor "ChildWindows"
- Move UI to separate project
	- Remove any state from UI classes (make sure they don't have mutable properties / fields)
	- Maybe add an analyzer to enforce all UI classes to be immutable and static, containing rendering logic only
- States should not be static
	- Make sure all states are passed as arguments to functions
- Use Dunet instead of F#?
- Remove all Debug.Assert calls
